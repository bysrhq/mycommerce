##Connect to remote repository from Windows with SSH which key generated from PuTTYGen

If you are a Windows user, it means you doesn't have ssh generator.
Unfortunately if use populare ssh generator like PuTTYGen,
you will be prompted for phasphrase and it never get delivered any repositories.
This is actually bug in OpenSHH as follow this link [1].

For fix this issue, you need to convert PuTTYGen format key to OpenSHH key
which in turns out can leverage remote repository with ssh protocol
as follow these procedure:

Open PuttyGen
Click Load
Load your private key
Go to Conversions->Export OpenSSH and export your private key
Copy your private key to ~/.ssh/id_rsa
